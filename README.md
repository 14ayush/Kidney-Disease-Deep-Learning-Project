### PROJECT WORKFLOW STEPS

Step 1 : Make the repository on Github name as (**[Kidney-Disease-Deep-Learning-Project](https://github.com/14ayush/Kidney-Disease-Deep-Learning-Project)**).Then clone the repository to the PC.

Step 2 : Make the python file name as (template.py ). In which we code to create the proper sequence of file and folders

Step 3 : Create the txt file( requirements.txt) in which we store all the libraries we want in this project

Step 4 : create the setup.py file which contain the setup of the project

Step 5 : Creating The logging exceptions an utils modules(

(logger :-   Logger help to know where we get the bug while running the file .it just simply return the time ,module, and the message of the bug )

[exception file :- To create the exception File we use the utils folder because here we use the box exception instead of custom exception using python box module(package) .inside the utils folder we create the (common.py) file

* In (**common.py )** file we make the all functions that used further in the project so to make the code flow easier we make the common file.
* What is config box :- config box help access the value of the dictonary vaue directly as we know all the yaml file we return the data in the dictonary formate
* **Ensure annotation :-**  It helps to prevent from the error if we provide the data type to a variable and it acts or work like another data type so it help to prevent us fro the error
